R is a programming language and software environment used mostly for statistical computing and graphic development 
by statisticians and data miners.


R Programming Langage
1. R grew out of the S programming language with lexical scoping semantics.  
   S was created by John Chambers while at Bell Labs
2. R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand in 1993 
is currently developed by the R Development Core Team, of which Chambers is a member. 
R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of S.[8]

R is a GNU project.[9] The source code for the R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R.[10] R is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems. While R has a command line interface, there are several graphical front-ends available.
