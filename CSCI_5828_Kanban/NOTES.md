**Kanban Process:**
* Kanban is rooted in four basic principles:
  * Start with existing process
    * The Kanban method does not prescribe a specific set of roles or process steps. The Kanban method starts with existing roles and processes and stimulates continuous, incremental and evolutionary changes to the system. The Kanban method is a change management method[citation needed].
  * Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
    * The organization (or team) must agree that continuous, incremental and evolutionary change is the way to make system improvements and make them stick. Sweeping changes may seem more effective but have a higher failure rate due to resistance and fear in the organization. The Kanban method encourages continuous small incremental and evolutionary changes to your current system.
  * Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities and titles
    * It is likely that the organization currently has some elements that work acceptably and are worth preserving. The Kanban method seeks to drive out fear in order to facilitate future change. It attempts to eliminate initial fears by agreeing to respect current roles, responsibilities and job titles with the goal of gaining broader support.
  * Leadership at all levels
    * Acts of leadership at all levels in the organization, from individual contributors to senior management, are encouraged.
