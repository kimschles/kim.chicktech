**What is Kanban:**

A framework to manage knowlege base work, such as software development, with an emphisis on just-in-time delivery while not overloading the team members.  

The name ‘Kanban’ comes from the Japanese symbol 看板 - which rougthly translates to signboard or Billboard.

**Origins of Kanban:**
In the 1940's, Toyoto studied supermarkets as a model of shelf-stocking techniques for the factory floor.

At any given time, the supermarket only stocks only what it expects to sell
Since future supply is assured, the customer retrieve only the item needed at the required time
This then causes the store to restock.
In supermarkets, signboards are used to guide the "shopping" processes to specific locations within the store

Kanban aligns inventory levels with actual consumption. A signal tells a supplier to produce and deliver a new shipment when material is consumed. These signals are tracked through the replenishment cycle, bringing visibility to the supplier, consumer, and buyer.

Kanban uses the rate of demand to control the rate of production, passing demand from the end customer up through the chain of customer-store processes. In 1953, Toyota applied this logic in their main plant machine shop.

**What is just in time delivery?**

The nature of just-in-time, meaning JIT manufacturing/production or JIT in any other setting, may be reduced to four somewhat differently stated views.

1. Many have said that JIT revolves around wastes: "At its core, JIT is a waste-elimination philosophy . . . ." Among the earliest writings on the matter, Shingo lists, as the "7 wastes," the wastes of: over-production, waiting, transportation, processing itself, stocks [inventories], motion, and making defective products.
2. Others have equated JIT production with kanban. For example, one book has both kanban and just-in-time in its main title.
3. Still others assert that JIT's main aim is elimination of inventories, although Murray maintains that "JIT is defined as 'NOT an inventory control system—but a way of thinking, working and management to eliminate wastes in the manufacturing process'.[28] In keeping with that view, JIT manufacturing has often been referred to in contrast to the more conventional just-in-case (JIC) mode: JIC keeps extra inventories to be used in case of disruptions (e.g., scrap, rework, equipment breakdowns, late deliveries), whereas JIT continually reduces such inventory buffers by continually attacking causes of disruptions.[29][need quotation to verify] Zero Inventories is the title of a 1983 book by Hall,[30] but the book actually does not suggest that JIT is mainly about inventory; rather the book features quick setup, cells (group technology), kanban, and so on, and zero inventory is posed only as an unattainable ideal, one that is easy to see and count
4. The fourth view is that JIT is mainly about quick response, relating to the "T"—for "time"—in JIT. As Blackburn put it, "Quick response is one of the major benefits of JIT. Time or speed is the linchpin of this manufacturing philosophy. Inventory, on the other hand, is an ancillary benefit."[31] Quick response refers alternatively to reduction of cycle times,[32] flow times, throughput times, and, all the way to the customer, lead times: "JIT," according to Bicheno, has the "provocative goal," of producing "instantaneously, with perfect quality and minimum waste," and he goes on to qualify "instantaneously" by saying, "The ideal way to produce the end product is literally just in time to meet the market demand for it. Thus, JIT is primarily a lead-time reduction programme."[33]

A methodology aimed primarily at reducing flow times within production as well as response times from suppliers and to customers


**Kanban Process:**
* Kanban is rooted in four basic principles:
  * Start with existing process
    * The Kanban method does not prescribe a specific set of roles or process steps. The Kanban method starts with existing roles and processes and stimulates continuous, incremental and evolutionary changes to the system. The Kanban method is a change management method[citation needed].
  * Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
    * The organization (or team) must agree that continuous, incremental and evolutionary change is the way to make system improvements and make them stick. Sweeping changes may seem more effective but have a higher failure rate due to resistance and fear in the organization. The Kanban method encourages continuous small incremental and evolutionary changes to your current system.
  * Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities and titles
    * It is likely that the organization currently has some elements that work acceptably and are worth preserving. The Kanban method seeks to drive out fear in order to facilitate future change. It attempts to eliminate initial fears by agreeing to respect current roles, responsibilities and job titles with the goal of gaining broader support.
  * Leadership at all levels
    * Acts of leadership at all levels in the organization, from individual contributors to senior management, are encouraged.
